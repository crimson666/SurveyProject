# SurveyProject
Survey Project by Angular and Java

In this project I used angular 6 as front-end framework

* Please install angular cli and after that run : npm install to get all the node depencency
* After that to launch the Application on browser run : ng serve -o
* Tha Frontend application is confuiged with backend's localhost:8080.

For the backend clint system should have Java 8 and up,OpenJDK 19, mysql 8g or up.

* Application is configed on 8080. 
* please run command : create database project; to create the DB.
* Sync Maven 
* run the application.

The Application contains two screens.

The First screen is for submitting the survey, It contains some basic questions along with one star rating input. When the user fills all the fields then it will aloow to submit
